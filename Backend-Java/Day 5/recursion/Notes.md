# The Fundamentals of Recursion in Java
Recursion is a problem-solving strategy in which a function divides an issue into smaller, related subproblems. Each recursive call tackles a smaller portion of the problem until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that ends the recursion.

## A Recursive Function's Structure
A recursive function in Java is made up of two parts:

### Base Case(s): 
These are the conditions that cause the recursion to end. When the base case is satisfied, the function ceases to call itself and begins returning values.

### Recursive Case(s): In this section, the function calls itself with changed arguments, getting closer to the basic case. To solve the original problem, the function typically combines the results of these recursive calls.
